# File-Sharing-Apis

These APIs can be used to share file over internet, using link via Mail. 
I have used MongoDB as a database to store files, that need to transfer to the particulare person and these data connect be accessed by any one.
I used sending blue to send file via emails.
I haven't created a frontend of it but working on it.

I hope u all will find it useful. Thank You!!!!
